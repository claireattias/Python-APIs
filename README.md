### Part 1: WeatherPy

You'll create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. You'll use the citipy Python library,the OpenWeatherMap API, and your problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.

You'll use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated in the starter code. Next, you'll create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships: Latitude vs. Temperature, Latitude vs. Humidity, Latitude vs. Cloudiness, Latitude vs. Wind Speed. Next, compute the linear regression for each relationship. 

### Part 2: VacationPy 

Use the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library and employ your Python skills to create map visualizations.
