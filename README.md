This activity examines how weather changes based on distance from the equator

### Part 1: WeatherPy

Part 1 creates a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. It uses the citipy Python library and the OpenWeatherMap API to create a representative model of weather across cities.

-OpenWeatherMap API is used to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated in the code.

Scatter plots are created to showcase the following relationships: 

-Latitude vs. Temperature

-Latitude vs. Humidity

-Latitude vs. Cloudiness

-Latitude vs. Wind Speed

Linear regression is then computed for each relationship. 

### Part 2: VacationPy 

Part 2 uses the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library to create map visualizations.
